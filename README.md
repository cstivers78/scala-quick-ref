# Scala Quick Reference 

Please feel free to use, fork, modify and make pull requests.


This is intended to be a living document/reference for Scala. I started this reference because I could not find a cheat-sheets or reference manuals that contains all the information I sometimes need in a concise format. 


This reference is divided into topics, each provides short overview of syntax/concepts/features with links to good external resources containing details.
